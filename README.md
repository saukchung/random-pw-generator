# Random Password Generator

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
     WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Description

This web application features a "Generate Password" button, which, when clicked, initializes a series of prompts that determines a set criteria that the password to-be=generated must follow.

The criteria are:
    1. Length of the password(between 8~124)
    2. Type of characters that can be in the password(Lower case, Upper case, Numbers, and Special characters(!,@,$,etc..))

Alerts are placed to guide the user if invalid choices are made. 

If both criteria are inputted correctly, the box returns a randomly generated password with the specified length and consisting of specified character types.

![The random password generator has a simple design that revolves around the text box, and the "Generate Password" button.](./assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-13%20at%201.01.04%20AM.png)
